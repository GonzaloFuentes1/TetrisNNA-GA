## TetrisNNA-GA

This repository contains a **genetic algorithm (GA)** implementation combined with a **neural network-based AI** to play the classic game of Tetris. The system evolves neural network models over generations to improve their performance, using parallel processing for efficiency.

### Features
- **Genetic Algorithm:** Optimizes neural network weights over multiple generations.
- **Parallel Execution:** Simultaneous Tetris AI instances to speed up training.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Fine-tune the genetic algorithm and neural network parameters for better results.
- **Visual Demonstration:** Watch multiple Tetris AIs running simultaneously.

### How It Works
1. **Population Initialization:** A population of neural network models is generated randomly.
2. **Fitness Evaluation:** Each model plays Tetris, and its performance is scored.
3. **Selection and Mutation:** The best-performing models are selected, and new models are created by mutating their weights.
4. **Parallel Execution:** Tetris games are run in parallel to accelerate fitness evaluation.
5. **Generational Evolution:** The process repeats for a specified number of generations to optimize performance.

#### Features Calculated by the AI
The following features are calculated for evaluating Tetris states:
1. **Aggregate Height:** Sum of the heights of all columns.
2. **Number of Holes:** Total empty spaces below blocks.
3. **Bumpiness:** Difference in heights between consecutive columns.
4. **Number of Pits:** Columns with zero blocks.
5. **Maximum Well Depth:** Depth of the deepest well (a column surrounded by higher columns).
6. **Columns with Holes:** Number of columns containing at least one hole.
7. **Row Transitions:** Number of horizontal transitions between empty and filled cells.
8. **Column Transitions:** Number of vertical transitions between empty and filled cells.
9. **Height Variance:** Variance in column heights.
10. **Highest Peak:** The maximum height among all columns.
11. **Minimum Height:** The minimum height among all columns.
12. **Density:** Ratio of holes to total blocks.
13. **Cleared Lines:** Number of rows cleared in a given move.
